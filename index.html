    <h1>Types OF Cyber Security Attacks</h1>
    <div class="dropdown">
      <button class="dropbtn">VIRUES</button>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        A computer virus is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to replicate and spread from one computer to
        another. It can attach itself to legitimate programs or files, causing damage to the host system or disrupting
        its normal functioning.The goals of computer viruses vary and may include causing harm, stealing information, or
        providing unauthorized access to a computer system. To protect against computer viruses, users often use
        antivirus software and adopt good cybersecurity practices, such as keeping software up to date and being
        cautious with email attachments and downloads

    <div class="dropdown">
      <button class="dropbtn">SQL Injection Attack</button>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        SQL injection is a type of cyber attack where malicious SQL (Structured Query Language) code is inserted into
        input fields or parameters of a web application. The goal is to manipulate the application's database by
        exploiting vulnerabilities in its code. This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or even the
        deletion of data. Proper input validation and the use of parameterized queries are essential defenses against
        SQL injection attacks.

    <div class="dropdown">
      <button class="dropbtn">Cross Site Scripting</button>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of web security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into
        web pages that are then viewed by other users. These scripts can execute in the context of the victim's browser,
        potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, manipulate content, or perform actions on
        behalf of the user. Prevention involves input validation, proper encoding, and implementing security mechanisms
        like Content Security Policy (CSP).

      <button class="dropbtn">Dos/DDos</button>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack or its more potent variant, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, aims
        to disrupt the normal functioning of a target's network or online service. In a DoS attack, a single source
        overwhelms the target with a flood of traffic, causing service unavailability. DDoS attacks involve multiple
        sources, often coordinated through a botnet, amplifying the impact. The goal is to exhaust the target's
        resources, bandwidth, or processing power, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users. Mitigation strategies
        include traffic filtering, load balancing, and the use of specialized DDoS protection services.

    <h1>Cyber Security Attacks</h1>

    <p>
      <b><u> August 2023:</u></b> Russian hacktivists launched DDoS attacks against Czech banks and the Czech stock
      exchange. The
      hackers cut online banking access to the banks clients and demanded that the institutions stop supporting
      Ukraine. Bank representatives claim the hacks did not threaten their clients finances. <br><br><br>
      <b><u>September 2023:</u></b> Indian hacktivists targeted Canada military and Parliament websites with DDoS
      attacks that
      slowed system operations for several hours. Hacktivists referenced Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau public
      accusation against India of killing Sikh independence activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar as motivation for the hack.
      <br><br><br>
      <u> <b>Octomber 2023:</b></u> Pro-Hamas and pro-Israeli hacktivists have launched multiple cyberattacks against
      Israeli government
      sites and Hamas web pages in the aftermath of Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th. Russian and Iranian
      hacktivists also targeted Israeli government sites, and Indian hacktivists have attacked Hamas websites in support
      of Israel.

    <h1>PAKISTAN</h1>
    <p><b><u>Federal Board of Revenue (FBR)</u></b><br>
      Most recently, the country’s tax collection authority suffered a cyber security breach after its software –
      Microsoft Hyper-V – was not timely updated.Although FBR restored its official website and its tax-related
      functions, hackers put the FBR’s data on sale on a Russian forum for $30,000 <br><br>
      <b><u> PATARI</u></b><br>
      Merely a couple of months ago in June, Patari, a famous Pakistani music streaming website, had been hacked, which
      resulted in the leak of the personal data and credentials of more than 257,000 users. <br><br>
      <b> <u>K-Electric</u></b><br>
      K-Electric, the company managing the generation, transmission, and distribution of power to a metropolitan, was
      hit by a cyberattack last year.
      The attackers threatened the management to pay a ransom of $7 million, or they would leak the information of KE’s
      customers on the dark web
